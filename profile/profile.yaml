# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a Software Developer with one year of experience and an Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Toronto. Throughout my academic journey, I gained a solid understanding of core computer science principles through courses in Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Design, Software Design, and Web Programming. In my current role as a Technical Consultant at Jarvis Consulting Group, I am constantly improving my technical skills, staying current with industry trends, and delivering innovative solutions that exceed client expectations. Previously, as a Junior Software Engineer at Fluid Mobility, I contributed to backend development by implementing an authentication solution using ASP.NET Core Identity, which increased security and reduced internal client login related issues. I enjoy environments where growth is driven by skill development and I am eager to apply my technical skills and positive attitude to roles that allow me to contribute to the development of innovative software solutions and effectively meet user needs.
