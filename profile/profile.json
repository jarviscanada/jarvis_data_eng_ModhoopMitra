      "description": "Developed a full-stack social media web application tailored for restaurant-related interactions, creating a robust platform for users to engage with restaurant profiles, blogs, feeds, and more. Utilized Django on the backend to build and extend models for user and restaurant profiles, blogs, and other features, and used SQLite as the database to store and manage data efficiently. To ensure scalability and flexibility, a REST API was implemented using the Django REST Framework. The frontend was developed using React, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface. React components interacted seamlessly with the Django backend through the REST API to fetch and update data. Bootstrap was employed for styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design across various devices.",

The backend was implemented with Node.js and Express.js to manage server-side operations, handle CRUD operations, and ensure efficient request processing. MongoDB was used for flexible data storage, and JWT authentication secured user access. Implemented the frontend with React to provide an intuitive UI for secure login, note viewing, and note creation.",
