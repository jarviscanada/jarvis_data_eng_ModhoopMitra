# Introduction
This project showcases the deployment of a scalable and secure Node.js Express application that processes trading data. The architecture incorporates a load balancer to distribute traffic effectively and auto-scaling capabilities to dynamically adjust the number of application pods based on demand. A PostgreSQL database serves as the persistent storage solution for all trading data. For development, the application runs in a local Kubernetes cluster using tools like Minikube or Docker Desktop, allowing for iterative testing and rapid changes. The production deployment is hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which ensures high availability and integrates Azure Load Balancer for managing traffic and Azure Container Registry (ACR) for hosting Docker images. The deployment pipeline is managed by Jenkins, which automates building, testing, and deployment tasks, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout the development lifecycle.

# Application Architecture
The application architecture consists of a Node.js Express server that handles trading-related requests and connects to a PostgreSQL database for storage. Traffic is routed through an Azure Load Balancer, which ensures even distribution across multiple application pods. These pods are managed within an AKS cluster, which uses auto-scaling to maintain performance during varying traffic loads. The architecture also integrates Kubernetes services and secrets to handle inter-pod communication and secure connections to external systems like the database. The development environment uses a lightweight Kubernetes setup for ease of iteration, while the production environment is optimized for scalability and reliability, leveraging Azure's managed services.

# Jenkins CI/CD pipeline
The Jenkins CI/CD pipeline automates the application delivery process to minimize manual intervention and ensure consistency. The pipeline begins with the git clone stage, where the latest changes are fetched from the Git repository. In the build stage, Azure CLI and Docker are used to create a container image of the application, tag it using Jenkins' BUILD_NUMBER, and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR). The test stage verifies the application by running unit tests and confirming the Kubernetes cluster's readiness. In the deploy stage, the pipeline connects to the AKS cluster using kubectl and updates the deployment to reference the newly built image. Once deployment is complete, the pipeline validates the application by listing all cluster resources. This CI/CD pipeline ensures seamless transitions from development to production.

# Improvements
1. Implement caching to increase image build efficiency.
2. Set up alerts for critical events like high CPU usage, memory leaks, or pod failures to ensure proactive issue resolution.
3. Optimize Jenkins build stages by running tests or image builds in parallel.
